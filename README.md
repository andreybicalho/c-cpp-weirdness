# Welcome to The Weirdness of C/C++
 
 These are my findings about the useful and weird stuff in C and C++. No libraries just STL.

 C/C++ is all about managing memory, so here you will find some cool tricks I picked-up along the way.

 This project has a VS solution with a bunch of projects. Each project regards a subject I found interesting.

 It is structured as follows:
 * Solution  
   * Project 1
   * Project 2
   * ...
   * Project N
